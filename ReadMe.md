# 🐾 RoyaleRex - eCommerce Pet Store 🛒

  An  eCommerce platform for pet essentials, built with the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
RoyaleRex makes shopping for your furry friends easy, seamless, and delightful!
  This web app was built in mind with the purpose to serve for a smaller target audience (2 districts) and maybe will expand afterwards.
  Front end is deployed on vercel and backend is deployed on render(has one minute delay to start server if there is no activity)
